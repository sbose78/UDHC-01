        &nbsp;How does the UDHC network ensure patient privacy and hide patient identity?
        </em></strong></span>
        <br />
        <br />
        We have to be very particular in protecting patient identity when sharing 
        patient data (pictures or history) over email as any breach in patient 
        confidentiality is legally unpardonable. We utilize a database of code names 
        which are botanical names and put your district pin code number in between the 
        two parts of the names so that we may have a rough (not exact) idea of the 
        patient&#39;s location. In our example we have given a botanical name to the patient 
        with numerical code and the name is (ABELMOSCHUS480***ESCULENTUS) Please further 
        go through these guidelines :<br />

        to help remove patient identifiers. We try to ensure that we don&#39;t get ourselves 
        as well as our beneficiaries into trouble even as we are trying to help them.<br />
        <br />
        <span class="style3">&nbsp;</span><em><strong><span class="style3">Why botanical 
        names? </span>
        <br />
        <br />
        </strong></em>The botanical names idea was to relate to health. Safeguarding the 
        health of the &#39;Earth&#39; lies to a large extent in&nbsp;<strong>protecting </strong>
        trees and other beings in our immediate environment and using &#39;botanical names&#39; 
        could be one way of gradually spreading plant awareness along with bodily health 
        awareness? Even though they are unwieldy they have a first and last name (and 
        one can after the permitted zip code add a numerical unique id in between the 
        first and last name). In our current web site under construction as soon as the 
        user registers s/he is automatically provided a name from botanical names 
        database. We may gradually ask some long term patients (who in near future would 
        own their web based open health records and botanical user names) to plant their 
        user-name (the real plant) and tend to it as well as their health and record. 
        Surely any human can find a small plot of land to do that (even if he doesn&#39;t 
        own the land).<br />
        <br />
        <em><strong><span class="style3">Does this activity have a marketable business 
        model?</span><br /> </strong></em><strong>
        <br />
        </strong>&nbsp;Our current model has more to do with &#39;Global learning toward local 
        caring&#39; rather than anything eminently marketable to cater to huge profits. With 
        this initiative we hope to be inching toward a sustainable health care learning 
        ecosystem. Our most important drivers are our network learners themselves, our 
        users ranging from patients, their relatives, other caregivers and a variety of 
        health professionals.</span></asp:Panel>
