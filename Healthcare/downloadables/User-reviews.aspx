        <strong><em>&nbsp;I am Kaustav Bera, a medical student, currently pursuing an 
        undergraduate training to become a doctor in Medical College, Kolkata. Currently 
        in the 3rd year of my course, i enjoy the process of learning beyond the usual 
        rigid framework of didactic lectures and textbook oriented education prevalent 
        in medical schools all over India. This passion for learning in an uncluttered 
        environment, where the individual&#39;s personalised skills is given more credence 
        over rote formulae based education, has led me to search for new avenues. In 
        this quest I came across the &#39;User Driven Learning&#39; Network. This was all what I 
        had hoped for, a scope for the process of learning by actually doing things, and 
        under the tutelage of the UDHC network that comprises global educators and 
        allied health professionals along with other interested fellow students from 
        India and beyond, I have been allowed to think beyond the traditional dictum. 
        This network, that i now represent, has allowed me to question findings without 
        quivering in fear of going wrong, it has allowed me to come to conclusions 
        myself as well as fostered the skill of unstructured and free thinking. Although 
        ignorant in the clinical decision making, the helpful and co-operative approach 
        of fellow &#39;Users&#39; in the system has prompted me to come to diagnoses often by 
        reading up on cases i would otherwise have no clue about. It has allowed me to 
        be aware of the various modalities of judgement and decision making skills which 
        would definitely allow me to become a better and more well-oriented health 
        professional.<br /> </em></strong>

        My name is Arin Basu, and I am an ENT surgeon, an Environmental Epidemiologist, 
        and a Health Services Researcher; I teach and work at the University of 
        Canterbury Health Sciences Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand. I have been 
        associated with the User Driven healthcare for a few years now and my interests 
        are in blending and researching the role of social media and web in user driven 
        health care movement. User driven health care is ushering in a new paradigm in 
        health care delivery aimed at not only empowering patients and caregivers, but 
        additionally, it aims to synthesize the patient&#39;s lived experiences and the 
        caregivers&#39; perspectives with real time physician perspective and expert skills 
        that are imparted at the level of the providers. More importantly, by bringing 
        in evidence based practice and knowledge base in the caregiving process, it not 
        only standardizes and contextualized treatment and a holistic patient 
        management, we are actually changing the paradigm of thinking and working about 
        patient care. This new generation of blending will create an informed patient 
        population, and will pave the way for enabling delivery of high quality health 
        care and bring effective, efficacious, efficient healthcare practices within 
        reach of you. You are the focus here. More power to user driven healthcare.

        I’m Joan Young In 1992 I was diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia, ITP, an 
        autoimmune disease where your body attacks your platelets. As treatment after 
        treatment failed and my platelet count hovered near zero, I began to look 
        elsewhere. Luckily I found a reiki nurse, macrobiotic counselors, an ayurvedic 
        physician, and others who helped me regain my health. The doctors I told 
        discounted my recovery, so I created a web site, and founded an organization to 
        help others diagnosed with ITP. That’s when I learned I was not alone. I heard 
        from many people who also discovered things outside of the medical mainstream 
        that raised their platelet count. There was a whole world of healing and 
        learning that was hidden. The stories just needed to be gathered, accepted, and 
        shared. We, the patients, were given a voice. We continue to learn from each 
        other. We continue to share and our collective wisdom has helped others recover 
        and live full lives. Joan Young Consultant Platelet Disorder Support Association
