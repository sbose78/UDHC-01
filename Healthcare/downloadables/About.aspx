            ‘User Driven Health Care’: Global Learning Toward Local Caring</em></span></strong><br />
            <br />
            <span class="style4"><span class="style6">The ‘User Driven Health Care’ web site 
            has been designed to provide comprehensive coverage and understanding of 
            clinical problem solving in healthcare.<br />
            <br />
            &nbsp;The term &quot;user&quot; includes health professionals as well as patients and anyone 
            who uses the web with a user name.
            <br />
            These &quot;users&quot; generate an information flow that &quot;drives&quot; the system&#39;s workflow 
            (hence the choice of the term &quot;driven&quot;).
            <br />
            <br />
            &quot;User-driven healthcare&quot; aims at improved healthcare through clinical problem 
            solving utilizing concerted experiential learning in conversations between 
            multiple users and stakeholders, primarily patients, health professionals, and 
            other actors in a care giving collaborative network across a Web interface. This 
            web site serves as a valuable platform for all these stakeholders to document 
            and share their learning.

            <span class="style4">This clinical problem solving forum evolved to address the 
            current problem of individual patients having to get themselves shunted between 
            multiple health professionals with multiple waiting times and we are trying to 
            develop this as a solution where just the patient’s information travels through 
            a network of dedicated health professionals rather than the patient having to 
            travel physically.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our clinical problem solving activity may be thought analogous to an &#39;artificial 
            neural network&#39; activity with inputs being processed through a network (in this 
            case through multiple human user inputs) until a concerted solution/outcome 
            emerges.
            <br />
            <br />
            All this may be archived and shared openly with patient anonymity similar to a 
            case reports journal<br />&nbsp;

            <br />
            but unlike a case reports journal the care- seekers (patients and their 
            relatives) on this web page are connected to responsible caregivers (social 
            workers, nurse-practitioners, physicians and other health professionals) who 
            shall maintain informational continuity in their care-seekers/patients to ensure 
            continued care through a virtually ‘persistent clinical encounter.’
